# Signs of AI Writing (Reference Summary)

Source: Wikipedia “Signs of AI writing”. This is an advice page, not a policy. The signs are heuristics and are not conclusive proof of AI authorship. Use them as a checklist for revision, not as a detector.

## Caveats

- These are patterns that *sometimes* correlate with AI-written text, but humans can write this way too.
- The list is descriptive, not a ban on words, phrases, or punctuation.
- Detection tools and human judgment are imperfect; use the list to improve clarity and authenticity, not to “prove” authorship.
- Some items are Wikipedia-specific (markup, citations, templates). Apply those only when relevant.
- Do not just “remove tells.” Fix the underlying issues (specificity, sourcing, neutrality, and accuracy).

## Content Signals

- **Overemphasis on significance or legacy** without evidence.
- **Overemphasis on notability/media coverage** rather than substance.
- **Superficial analysis** that states the obvious, stays generic, or avoids specifics.
- **Promotional/advertising tone** or brand-polish language.
- **Vague attributions** ("experts say", "many believe") without sources.
- **Boilerplate conclusions** about “challenges” and “future prospects” with no concrete detail.
- **Treating list or category names as proper nouns** (capitalization for emphasis rather than correctness).

## Language and Grammar Signals

- **Overused “AI vocabulary” words** (e.g., “delve”, “crucial”, “pivotal”, “landscape”, “harness”, “foster”).
- **Avoidance of simple copulas** (“is/are”) by swapping in more complex verbs unnecessarily.
- **Negative parallelisms** repeated (“not X but Y”, “not only A but also B”).
- **Rule of three overuse** (triplets in sentence structure or lists that feel formulaic).
- **Elegant variation** (synonym-swapping for the same concept to avoid repetition).
- **False ranges** (ranges of years or quantities presented without evidence).

## Style and Formatting Signals

- **Title case headings** where sentence case would be expected.
- **Overuse of bold text** to compensate for weak structure.
- **Inline-header vertical lists** (single line headings followed by stacked short lines).
- **Overuse of em dashes** or overly consistent punctuation patterns.
- **Odd or unnecessary tables** that add little value.
- **Emoji in formal contexts** where it feels out of place.

## Communication Signals (Assistant-Like)

- **Collaborative/assistant tone** (“Sure, I can help with that”).
- **Knowledge cutoff disclaimers** or meta statements about training data.
- **Template phrasing** that reads like a stock response.

## Markup and Citation Signals (Wikipedia-Specific)

- **Markdown artifacts** in wikitext contexts.
- **Broken or invalid markup** for references or templates.
- **Search links or tracking parameters** embedded in citations.
- **Invalid or placeholder identifiers** (e.g., fake ISBN/DOI patterns).
- **Unused named references** or inconsistent citation formatting.

## Ineffective Indicators (Not Reliable on Their Own)

- Perfect grammar or a formal tone by itself.
- Mixed formal and casual language.
- “Polite” or “robotic” phrasing without other signals.

## Signs of Human Writing (Contextual)

- Text that predates ChatGPT’s public release (Nov 30, 2022).
- The author can explain editorial choices in detail.

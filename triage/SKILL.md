# /triage

Triage quickly with this priority order: `in_progress` > `todo` > `claw_inbox`.

## Tool use
1) Use `plane-api` to fetch active work first:
  - action: "list"
  - limit: 20
  - filters.state: "in_progress"

2) Use `plane-api` to fetch queued work next:
  - action: "list"
  - limit: 20
  - filters.state: "todo"

3) Use `plane-api` to fetch inbox candidates:
  - action: "list"
  - limit: 20
  - filters.labels: ["claw_inbox"]

4) Build recommendations with priority ordering:
  - in_progress items first
  - then todo items
  - then claw_inbox items

5) If user chooses actions (e.g. "mark #2 high priority", "set due tomorrow", "archive #5"),
   use `plane-api` action: "update" with the relevant patch.

## Output
- Top 5 next actions (1 line each, why + next step)
- Split/clarify candidates
- One question max if needed (e.g. "Is this work or personal?")
